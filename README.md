📘 Bright Car Sales Dataset – README
📂 Overview
The Bright Car Sales dataset contains daily transactional and pricing information for vehicles sold by Bright Motors. This dataset is intended to support sales analysis, inventory optimization, and strategic decision-making for dealership expansion.

Bright Motors has recently appointed a new Head of Sales, whose mission is to:
